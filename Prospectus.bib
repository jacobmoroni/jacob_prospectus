abstract = {In appearance-based localization and mapping, loop- closure detection is the process used to determinate if the cur- rent observation comes from a previously visited location or a new one. As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored loca- tions, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop-closure detection approach for large-scale and long- term operation. The approach is based on amemorymanagement method,which limits the number of locations used for loop-closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and fre- quently observed locations in a working memory (WM) that is used for loop-closure detection, and transferring the others into a long-term memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations that are stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for addi- tional loop-closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard datasets from other appearance-based loop-closure approaches, one custom dataset us- ing real images taken over a 2-km loop of our university campus, and one custom dataset (7 h) using virtual images from the racing video game “Need for Speed:MostWanted.”},
